The mobile web site of Cleartrip had not changed for five years. The experience was slow and clunky. It had started showing its age.

In the meantime, mobile devices had gotten faster and more powerful. Our product offerings had evolved.

For the first time, since the inception of Cleartrip, we had reached a stage where traffic to the mobile site was almost equal to our desktop site.

Updating the mobile experience became a top priority. This provided us with an opportunity to design and build the mobile site from the grounds up.

## Banking on a Progressive Web App

After considering a few different approaches we landed on creating a Progressive Web App.

This gave us a lot of benefits including:-

- Accessible in slower network speeds, this was imperative for us as majority of our users were located in emerging markets.
- A fast, native app-like browsing and booking experience, a huge step up from our previous site.
- Faster loading times compared to responsive or m-dot websites, due to service workers and aggressive caching

## Focus on speed

From the beginning, speed was a major area of focus.

As per a [study](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/) conducted by Google, low page load times have a direct relationship with low bounce rate.

In another [study](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/), they established that this is especially true in travel sectors as a 0.1-second improvement can increase conversion rates by 10.1%.

While building the site, we were conscious about adding features and unnecessary bloat which would increase page load times.

## Perceived Speed

As designers we contributed by designing for perceived speed. That is influencing the user to believe the site is faster than it truly is.

Here are a few tactics we employed to that end:-

## Ripple States

Popularised by Material Design, ripple states are an excellent tool to reduce the perceived time between the initiation and the execution of an action.

By introducing a small animation where the user taps, we provide feedback and momentarily capture the users attention while action processes in the background.

Consider the following examples:-

## Skeleton Screens

This pattern popularised by Facebook acts as a placeholder while the content loads

The shimmer effect simulates movement and activity. This is much better than an empty screen or a loading spinner.

## Carry Over Content

Carrying over key pieces of content from previous screens is a great way to keep the user engaged. We can utilise the time the user takes to read or scan content to load rest off the page.

This has the added benefit of maintaining context when moving between pages.

## Progress indicators

Progress indicators are useful for longer wait times. It keeps the user informed and reduces the uncertainty by quantifying the waiting period.

This was a perfect fit for our search results page where the api fetched data from multiple sources. This often took a couple of seconds to complete.

## Transitional States


Animation is a useful tool to guide the users eye.

We animated the incoming and outgoing content to communicate the change in state. This is much better than a snap change.

We used these transitional states when populating additional information on the screens, for example, for filters and sorts.

## Modal spinners

We employed full-screen modal spinners only as a  last resort when we could not use any other loading indicator due to tech limitations.

Communicating wait times are an essential addition to modal spinners. Wherever possible, we tried to add help text to the spinners.
