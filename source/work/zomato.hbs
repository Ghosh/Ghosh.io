          <a href="http://www.zomato.com/" target="_blank">Zomato</a> is a global restaurant search and discovery service. It provides restaurant information, such as scanned menus and photos, as well as user reviews and ratings amongst other features and offerings.

        </h5>

        <p>
          I spent the better half of two years working with the product team at Zomato. During this period I had the opportunity to be a part of both the Design and Development Teams. This gave me a unique perspective of the underlying methodology and process required to build a successful product.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent a few initial months working on the design team and then slowly transitioned to the front end team. I helped create a new responsive grid to power the now responsive web site and contributed to developing  the interfaces and features for new releases.

        </h5>
        <p>
          At a time when Zomato was experiencing high growth and expanding rapidly to international markets, it became important to present to the growing customers a look into the company, the people behind it, itâ€™s culture etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was tasked with designing the pages which represented the company and the values for which it stands, highlight the people behind the scenes and why it does what it does.
