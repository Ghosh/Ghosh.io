          As the name suggests, <a href="http://moodboard.io/" target="_blank">Moodboard.io</a> is a simple tool which provides users a private place to store all visual inspiration and create a visual moodboard for their projects.

          <span>Objectives</span>
        </h5>

        <p>
          Being the sole driving force behind this project, it was important for me to work smart and maximize the output from the effort involved. However, the main priority here was the user experience and the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keeping in mind the various requirements and the project constraints, it quickly became clear to me the key objectives of the project. I needed to design an interface which was:-
        </p>


        <ul class="objective objective--triple objective--moodboard">

          <li class="objective__item">
            Build an interface which is intuitive and puts focus on the users content without compramising usabilty
          </li>

          <li class="objective__item">
            The design should be flexible to accomodate future business requirements and features
          </li>

          <li class="objective__item">
            The visual language should be modularized to make all products feel part of the same family
          </li>

        </ul>

            <span>Wireframing</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            After shortlisting a few different variations from the initial sketches, I created a few full scale wireframes which helped me get a better understand the nuances of each screen and identify possible short comings in some the layouts.
          </p>

          <p>
            After this stage, I decided upon three major things:-
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Remove the quick access board’s navigation from the left of the screen and instead opted for utilizing that space to better showcase the user’s content
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a secondary navigation below the main head to house the page details and view actions like sorting, filterings, layout modes etc
            </li>
            <li>
               Opt for a full page view of the content detail page rather than a in place modal
            </li>
          </ul>

        </h5>

        <p>
          At this point I had the peices I needed and was clear in my head about the direction I wanted to take with the visual design. I started creating the designs keeping in mind the initial objectives of making it intuitive and extendable at the same time.

        <h3 class="section-subheading mt40 mb10">Navigation</h3>

        <p>
          Being an app with a relatively less number of “pages” the navigation aspect was quite straight forward. A breadcrumb serves the dual purpuse of acting as a navigation helper as well as informing the user of his location at any given moment.

          Utilizing the secondary navigation for page action is a flexible approach as it provides a permanent location at the top of the page for all actions and other actions can be added or removed in the future depending upon page and business needs.

        <p>
          The starting page of the app, displays tumbs of the various moodboards created. The main action on the card apart from viewing it is to favourite. The card also exposes some relavant information such as the number of pins in it, last updated timestamp etc.
