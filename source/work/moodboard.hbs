          As the name suggests, <a href="http://moodboard.io/" target="_blank">Moodboard.io</a> is a simple tool which provides users with a private place to store all inspiration collected from various places over the internet and create a visual moodboards for their projects.

          <span>Objectives</span>
        </h5>

        <p>
          This project started out due to a personal problem of not being able to store and more importantly consume the content in a way which suited me. Being the sole driving force behind this project, it was important for me to work smart and maximize the output from the effort involved.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keeping in mind the various requirements and the project constraints, it quickly became clear to me the key objectives of the project. I needed to design an product experience and interface which should be:-
        </p>


        <ul class="objective objective--triple objective--moodboard">

          <li class="objective__item">
            Intuitive and put focus on the users content without compromising usability
          </li>

          <li class="objective__item">
            Flexible to accommodate future business requirements and product features
          </li>

          <li class="objective__item">
            Modularized to enable reuse of components for supporting interfaces
          </li>

        </ul>

            <span>Wireframing</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            I started by creating a few rough sketches on paper. After shortlisting a few different variations, I created a few full scale, low fidelity wireframes which helped me get a better understand the nuances of each screen and identify possible short comings in some the layouts.
          </p>

          <p>
            After this stage, I decided upon three major things:-
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              To move away from a standard left side navigation and instead utilize the full width of the screen to display the pins (images)
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a secondary navigation below the main head to house the page details and view actions like sorting, filtering, layout modes etc.
            </li>
            <li>
               Opt for a full page view of the content detail page rather than an overlayed modal
            </li>
          </ul>

        </div>
      </div>

        <p>
          Once I was satisfied with the basic skeleton of the layout and the placement of the action buttons, I proceeded to finalized some the brand assets such as the primary color palette, fonts, and iconography

        </h5>

        <p>
          At this point I had the pieces I needed and was clear in my head about the direction I wanted to take with the visual design. I started creating the designs keeping in mind the initial objectives of making it intuitive and extendable at the same time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading mt40 mb10">Navigation</h3>

        <p>
          Being an app with a relatively less number of “pages” the navigation aspect was quite straight forward. A breadcrumb serves the dual purpose of acting as a navigation helper as well as informing the user of his location at any given moment.

            The secondary navigation houses some of the actions possible on the view such as downloading, sharing a link, creating a new model, accessing screen settings etc. This is extendable as actions can be added or removed as required

        <p>
          The secondary header houses the screen specific action items. This approach is flexible and future-proof as it provided a consistent location to place all action items, while maintaining the ability to add or remove specific items from the list depending upon the product features or business requirements.

        <h3 class="section-subheading mt40 mb10">Boards</h3>

        <p>
          After logging into the app, the first screen that the user sees is the boards screen. This houses thumbnails of all the moodboards by that user. Apart from showing the latest three items added to the moodboard, the thumbs also display some addition information such as the number of pins in it, last updated timestamp, main action items etc.
