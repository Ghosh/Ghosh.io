        </h5>

        <p>
          My role in this project was to streamline the interface and make the different features of the product easy to interpret and simple to use. For this project I collaborated with the in-house product team and designers.

          After getting up-to-date with the research, flows and wireframes established by the rest of the team, we quickly moved onto the next phase of the design cycle, which was actually designing the product.

        <p>
          At the core of the product is an e-commerce store from where the users can exchange the gems awarded to them by their managers and superiors as a reward or recognition for their hard work, for products in the store.

        <p>
          As there would be multiple pages worth of products to display to the user in the future, it was decided to add a simple filter which would aid the user to narrow down the catalouge should he/she chose to do so.
