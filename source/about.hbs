      <p class="about__text">
        I have been on a non-standard path both personally and professionally. With my father serving in the Armed Forces, I have grown up in 13 schools, 26 states and 3 countries, I have had the good fortune of being exposed to multiple cultures and meeting all kinds of people over the course of my short but eventful life. This has led me to develop an unique outlook towards life. I try and actively make use of my learnings and apply them to my work where ever I can.

        Professionally I have a background in digital marketing but transitioned over to the product world around 5 years back. Since that time I have worked with a wide variety of people and companies including small businesses, early stage startups and billion dollar companies. My interests extend beyond just pretty pixels and clean code. I have an interest in conversion rate optimization, data driven design and analytics.
